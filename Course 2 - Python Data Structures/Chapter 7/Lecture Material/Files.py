'Using open()'
#handle = open(filename, mode)
#returns a handle use to manipulate the file
#filename is a string
#mode is optional and should be 'r' if we are planning
#   to read the file and 'w' if we are going to write in the file
#EX: fhand = open('mbox.txt', 'r') || open('mbox.txt')

'The newline Character'
stuff = 'Hello\nWorld!'
#Hello
#World!
#each line in a text file actually has a newline character at the end of each line
#it isn't just magical, undetectable syntax. It is also a single character, not two.
