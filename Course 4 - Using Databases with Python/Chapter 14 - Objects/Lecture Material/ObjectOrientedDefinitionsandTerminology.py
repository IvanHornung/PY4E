'Object Oriented'
#A program is made up of many cooperating objects
#Instead of being the "whole program" - each object is a little "island" within the pogram and cooperatively working with other objects
#A program is made up of one or more objects working together - objects make use of each other's capabilities

'Object'
#*An object is a bit of self-contained Code and Data
#A key aspecct of an Object approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable parts (divide and conquer)
#Objects have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail.
#We have been using objects all along: String Objects, Integer Objects, Dictionary Objects, List Objects...

'Definitions'
#Class - a template
#Method or Message - A defined capability of a class
#Field or attribute - A bit of data in a class
#Object or Instance - A particular instance of a class
