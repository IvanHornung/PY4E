'Service Oriented Approach'
#Most non-trivial web applications use services
#They use services form other applications
#   -Credit Card Charge
#   -Hotel Reservation systems
#Services publish the "rules" applications must follow to make use of the service (API)

'Multiple Systems'
#Initially - two systems cooperate and split the problem.
#As the data/service becomes useful - multiple applications want to use the information application
